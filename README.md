# Deck of random cards

## About

A simple deck of random cards.

## Starting

**Youâ€™ll need to have Node 14.0.0 or later version on your local development machine**. I recommend using the latest LTS version. You can use [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#installation) (macOS/Linux) or [nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows#node-version-manager-nvm-for-windows) to switch Node versions between different projects. I recommend [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/) as an optional installation.

Install as application dependencies using the command:

```bash
npm install
#or
yarn install
```

To launch the application in **development mode**, you can choose one of the following methods:

```sh
npm run dev
#or
yarn run dev
```
